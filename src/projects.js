Then someone on discord had asked if I made them and I said yes and he asked if I could build him an economy bot for his server. After building the bot I decided to make the bot public. This bot has a server leaderboard and has many different ways of making money. It uses prefix commands.",

There's a menu where you can either gamble, check your bank account, see previous races, or quit. Each race is stored in a separate file so you can always see the race. Each dog also has their own percent chances of winning and you can choose any of them.",
